Hawaii is known for having great weather year-round, and this is reflected in the above historical temperature statistics for June and December.  
Average (mean) temps do not vary much between June and December, 74.9 and 71.0, respectively, suggesting that people would in the mood for ice cream or to ride some surf in June or December. 
High temps are also stable from June (85F) to December (83F), which is great news for a temperature-dependent business model like surf equipment and ice cream. 
Low temps vary a bit more, 64F in June historically, and 56F in December. This could be reflected in lower numbers of patrons to the shop when it's colder in December.

## Summary 
Hawaii's weather makes it a fine location for an ice cream and surf shop. They enjoy temps in the 70's year-round, which is great weather for ice cream and/or surfing. Additional queries of interest would be to gather data on inclement weather, as well as the pattern of influx of tourists month to month, to better gauge demand for smarter staff and inventory decisions.
